  <h1>Perrin Grant's Portfolio</h1> <!-- Main title of the page -->
  <h2>A small collection of art works I have created for research and social groups at 
    the University of Edinburgh</h2> <!-- Subtitle describing the purpose of the portfolio -->

  <div class="gallery"> <!-- Container for all image groups -->

    <div class="image-row"> <!-- First image group -->

      <img src="images/SCIFFY_mono.png" alt="SCIFFY monochrome logo"> <!-- Monochrome version -->
    </div>
    <p>Logo created for the University of Edinburgh Science Fiction and Fantasy Society. 
      Adopted by the society as the official logo in 2018, and was used on all society 
      advertising, documentation and merchandise until the society was disbanded in 2024.

    <div class="image-row"> <!-- Second image group -->
      <img src="images/bumblebee_brigade_logo.png" alt="Bumblebee Brigade logo"> <!-- Logo for research group -->
    </div>
    <p>Logo created for Alix Prybyla's research group (Stone lab, University of Edinburgh), 
      nicknamed the Bumblebee Brigade. The logo was primarily used as a profile for social 
      media posts about the group, and on team t-shirts during outreach events. The logo 
      depicts the five most common species of bumblebee found in Edinburgh.

    <p>Logos used on promotional materials and bingo cards for the annual Bingo Bees event at the Royal 
      Botanic Garden Edinburgh, running while the Bumblebee Brigade was collecting data there from 2022 
      (left) to 2024 (right). Each year Alix Prybila would choose a star bee to be depicted on the logo.

    <p>Logo designed to go on hoodies for the students and staff taking part in the 3rd year 
      undergraduate research trip to Millport on the Island of Great Cumbrae for the University of 
      Edinburgh Field Zoology Course. The course involved practicing field techniques in the popular 
      game Minecraft, so a Minecraft turtle was chosen to feature in the logo. Barnacles were also 
      chosen as an appropriate inclusion on the logo as they are common on Great Cumbrae's beaches, 
      along with Millport's famous 'Crocodile Rock' landmark.

    <div class="image-row"> <!-- Fifth image group with square styling -->

        <img src="images/camera_rig.png" alt="Bee photography rig">
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The camera rig designed to take consistent pictures of Bumblebee wings for Alix Prybyla's PhD project.
      It was printed by the UCreate service at the University of Edinburgh Central Library. It was designed to 
      be printed in two parts that could be easily slotted and glued together due to the limited sizes of the 
      printers available. One side (closest in the above image) was designed to fit the field camera precisely, 
      with holes for straps so it could be secured once slotted in. The opposite side has a slot to insert graph 
      paper, which is an ideal material to slide between a bee's wings and body for clear photography. The purpose 
      of this rig was to ensure a set distance between the camera lens and wings. This not only saved time 
      since the camera never needed to refocus, but also allowed for far easier and automated image analysis 
      as one scale bar could be applied to every image.

    <p>Logo entered into a competition to design the new logo for the University of Edinburgh Biology Society 
      (BioSoc) in 2023. This logo was not selected.
