  <h2>A small collection of art works I have created for research and social groups at 
    the University of Edinburgh</h2>

      <img src="images/SCIFFY_mono.png" alt="SCIFFY monochrome logo">
    </div>
    <p>Logo created for the University of Edinburgh Science Fiction and Fantasy Society. 
      Adopted by the society as the official logo in 2018, and was used on all society 
      advertising, documentation and merchandise until the society was disbanded in 2024.
    </p>
  
      
  <div class="image-row">
    <img src="images/bumblebee_brigade_logo.png" alt="Bumblebee Brigade logo">
  </div>
  <p>Logo created for Alix Prybyla's research group (Stone lab, University of Edinburgh), 
    nicknamed the Bumblebee Brigade. The logo was primarily used as a profile for social 
    media posts about the group, and on team t-shirts during outreach events. The logo 
    depicts the five most common species of bumblebee found in Edinburgh.

  <div class="image-row">

    <img src="images/bee_bingo_2023.png" alt="Bingo Bees 2023 logo">
    <img src="images/bee_bingo_2024.png" alt="Bingo Bees 2024 logo">
  </div>
  <p>Logos used on promotional materials and bingo cards for the annual Bingo Bees event at the Royal 
    Botanic Garden Edinburgh, running while the Bumblebee Brigade was collecting data there from 2022 
    (left) to 2024 (right). Each year Alix Prybila would choose a star bee to be depicted on the logo.

      <img src="images/millport_2022_mono.png" alt="Millport monochrome logo">
  </div>
  <p>Logo designed to go on hoodies for the students and staff taking part in the 3rd year 
    undergraduate research trip to Millport on the Island of Great Cumbrae for the University of 
    Edinburgh Field Zoology Course. The course involved practicing field techniques in the popular 
    game Minecraft, so a Minecraft turtle was chosen to feature in the logo. Barnacles were also 
    chosen as an appropriate inclusion on the logo as they are common on Great Cumbrae's beaches, 
    along with Millport's famous 'Crocodile Rock' landmark.
